# ezSCUP: SCALE-UP made easy.

ezSCUP is a Python module designed to facilitate the execution of SCALE-UP simulations in a parameter grid of temperatures, pressures, strains and/or electric fields, providind a high-level interface to handle the program and its output.

SCALE-UP (short for **S**econd-principles **C**omputational **A**pproach for **L**attice and **E**lectrons) is a Second-Principles DFT simulation program written in Fortran and developed by researchers from the University of Catabria (UC, Spain) and the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST), as well as by a number of collaborators [[+info]](https://www.secondprinciples.unican.es/).  

This module has been developed as part of my Bachelor's final-year thesis.
