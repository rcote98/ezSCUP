## SrTiO3: AFD Phase Transition

In this example we simulated how bulk STO responds to temperature changes when no strain restrictions applied. The antiferrodistrotive (AFD) phase transition that appears is a well characterized phenomenon, and hence we used it in [my thesis](https://www.google.es) in order to benchmark the mode-projection algorithm.
