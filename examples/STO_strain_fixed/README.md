## SrTiO3: Fixed-Strain Simulations

In this example we simulated how STO responds to temperature changes under several epitaxial strain restrictions, menaing that we kept the x and y strain components fixed while letting the z component relax.

This situation is similar to how STO crystals are grown epitaxially, as the substrate imposes epitaxial strain restrictions in the STO thin film. For more information on the topic you can check my thesis [here](https://www.google.es).
